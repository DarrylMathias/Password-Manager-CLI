### Hobby Project Disclaimer  
This is a hobby project and comes with **no guarantees** for the security or safety of your stored passwords. Use it **at your own risk**.  

### Do Not Delete Critical Files  
Do **not delete `data.txt` or the `accounts/` folder**, even by mistake. They serve as the **database** and are necessary for storing your passwords. If deleted, all stored data will be lost permanently.  

### Antivirus Warning
